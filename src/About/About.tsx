                I am a passionate fullstack developer located in Wroc≈Çaw. Besides being into web
                technologies I am interested in VR and chess. I love to plan ahead, learn new skills
                and develop myself further in them. I enjoy working as team. My native language is
                Polish and I am fluent in English.
